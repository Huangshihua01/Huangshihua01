- 👋 Hi, I’m @Huangshihua01, a physics graduate student at Purdue University.
- 👀 I’m interested in experimental high energy physics with a focus on flavor changing muon physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontier muon physics experiments, Mu2e, MEG, Mu3e, Muon g-2, etc.
- 📫 Reach me at huans1151@purdue.edu, or make phone call at +1(737)-615-8074.
